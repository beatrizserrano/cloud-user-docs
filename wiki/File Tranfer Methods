scp
command line tool for connection-wise copying of files



sshfs
mounts a remote filesystem locally to enable CLI and GUI access

mkdir mountpoint

mounting (absolute paths are required!)
sshfs user@hostname:/absolute/path/to/remote/directory mountpoint -o IdentityFile=/absolute/path/to/identity_file -p portnumber

unmounting (unmounting only works for full mountpoint (e.g. sshfs user@hostname:/dir relative/mountpoint -> mountpoint has path "relative/mountpoint" not only "mountpoint")
fusermount -u mountpoint



sftp
file access via secure FTP



rsync
incremental synchronization between remote and local folders
