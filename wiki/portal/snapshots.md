## Snapshots

A snapshot is an exact copy of your virtual machine. A snapshot of an instance can be used as the basis of an instance and booted up at a later time. 

### Create Snapshot

After starting a machine you can go to instance overview and create a snapshot. ![create snapshot](img/createsnap.png)
