### Inviting Members

Through invitation links users can be easily added to a de.NBI Cloud project. The process is the following:

* __Step 1__: Send the invitation link which you can find in the "Add Member" modal to the user you want to add (see figure of the previous section).

* __Step 2__: By using this link the user will be requested to register for an ELIXIR and de.NBI Cloud account. In the final step the
user also registers for your project.

* __Step 3__: You will be informed by mail as soon as the user submits an application. You can then approve the application
in the application modal. Once the application is approved the user will have access to your project.
