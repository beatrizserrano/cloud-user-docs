## Modification

If you want to extend a project or adjust various parameters, you can create a modification request.
You can submit a modification request by selecting the "Applications" tab and clicking on the "Request Extension/Modification" button (see below).

Then a new window opens in which the parameters of your project can be adjusted. 
On the left side are the current parameters and on the right side are input fields where you can enter new parameters for your project.
